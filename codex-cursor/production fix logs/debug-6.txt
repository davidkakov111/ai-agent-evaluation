Great catch — both are implementation issues, and now fixed.
What I changed
Backend rule added: DONE tasks are frozen for reassignment
File: src/server/services/taskService.ts
assignTask() now throws InvalidTransitionError if task status is DONE.
UI status buttons now respect transition rules
File: src/features/tasks/TaskWorkspace.tsx
Added the same transition map used by backend logic:
TODO -> IN_PROGRESS
IN_PROGRESS -> TODO | DONE
DONE -> IN_PROGRESS
Disabled buttons for invalid next states (e.g., DONE button disabled from TODO).
UI reassign control hidden for completed tasks
File: src/features/tasks/TaskWorkspace.tsx
Reassign form now only renders when task is not DONE.
Validation
npm run lint ✅
npm run typecheck ✅
npm run test:run ✅
So now behavior matches your expectation: completed tasks are effectively frozen for reassignment, and invalid transition actions are visibly disabled in the UI.
