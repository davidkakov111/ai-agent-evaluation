Yes — this is an implementation mistake (UI permission gating), not a planning or prompt mistake.
What was wrong
The task creation form visibility depended on a server-prop (canManage) and could drift from the actual current auth state in the client.
Fix applied
I updated task UI gating to use the live authenticated role from trpc.auth.me:
src/features/tasks/TaskWorkspace.tsx
Removed prop-based gating
Added me query
Shows create/reassign controls only when role is OWNER or ADMIN
And updated callers:
src/app/(app)/(org)/dashboard/page.tsx
now uses <TaskWorkspace />
src/app/(app)/(org)/tasks/page.tsx
now uses <TaskWorkspace />
removed unused session logic
Validation
npm run lint ✅
npm run typecheck ✅
Now employees should no longer see the task creation form, which aligns UI with backend authorization.
