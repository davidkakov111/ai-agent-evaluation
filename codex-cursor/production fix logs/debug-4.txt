This is an implementation/UI styling issue, not a planning mistake.
I can fix it quickly by styling the select/options explicitly (e.g., color: #111) so role options are readable on white backgrounds in all themes.
If you want, I’ll apply it now to the join-approval dropdown component.

Applied.
I updated the join-approval dropdown so role text is explicitly dark/black:
src/features/join-requests/JoinRequestsPanel.tsx
select now has style={{ color: "#111111" }}
both options also explicitly set color: "#111111"
Validation:
npm run lint ✅
npm run typecheck ✅

Fixed.
The dropdown now uses a dedicated class so both:
the closed select control, and
the opened options list
render with consistent readable colors (white background + dark text).
Changes made
src/features/join-requests/JoinRequestsPanel.tsx
switched from inline styles to className="input join-role-select"
src/app/globals.css
added:
.join-role-select {  background: #ffffff;  color: #111111;}.join-role-select option {  background: #ffffff;  color: #111111;}
Validation
npm run lint ✅
npm run typecheck ✅
So now you should no longer get black-on-black in the closed state while keeping options readable when opened.
