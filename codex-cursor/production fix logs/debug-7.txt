Fixed.
Now if reassignment fails (including invalid employee ID), the UI shows a clear error message on that task card.
What changed
src/features/tasks/TaskWorkspace.tsx
Added per-task error state: assignErrorByTaskId
Switched reassignment action to await assignTask.mutateAsync(...) with try/catch
Displays a banner error under the relevant task when reassignment fails
Keeps existing success behavior (task list invalidation) unchanged
Validation
npm run lint ✅
npm run typecheck ✅
So now invalid reassignment attempts are visible in the UI instead of failing silently.

Agreed — that message was not user-friendly.
I updated the task reassignment error handling to map technical validation errors into readable UI text.
Now shown instead of raw JSON
Invalid CUID / malformed assignedToId → “Employee ID format is invalid.”
User not in org / not employee → “Employee ID is invalid for your organization.”
DONE task reassignment attempt → “Completed tasks cannot be reassigned.”
Other failures → generic safe message
File updated
src/features/tasks/TaskWorkspace.tsx
Validation
npm run lint ✅
npm run typecheck ✅
If you want, I can apply the same friendly-error mapping pattern to join-request mutations too so all mutation errors are consistently human-readable.
