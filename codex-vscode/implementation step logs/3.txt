Implemented Step 3 only: Prisma data model + migration baseline + seed data.

DB schema completed

Added enums Role, TaskStatus, JoinRequestStatus and all required models:
User, Account, Session, VerificationToken, Organization, Membership, JoinRequest, Task
Added one-org-per-user constraint via unique membership:
Membership.userId @unique
Added org/task/join-request indexes for expected query patterns.
Added explicit note about SQLite partial-index limitation (pending join request uniqueness must be enforced in services/transactions).
File: schema.prisma

Migration baseline created

First migration SQL generated and committed at:
migration.sql
migration_lock.toml
Seed baseline created

Added deterministic seed script with:
4 users (owner/admin/employee/candidate)
1 org (acme)
memberships (OWNER, ADMIN, EMPLOYEE)
1 pending join request
sample tasks across statuses
File: seed.mjs
Added script:
npm run prisma:seed
Config updates

Fixed SQLite path to standard Prisma-relative path:
.env.example now uses dev.db"
Updated scripts in package.json for seed usage.
Validation

npm run prisma:validate ✅
npm run prisma:generate ✅
npm run prisma:seed ✅
npm run typecheck ✅
npm run lint ✅
npm run test ✅
npm run build ✅
Important environment note

In this container, prisma migrate dev/deploy returns a generic schema-engine runtime error.
To still complete Step 3, I generated the migration SQL via prisma migrate diff and applied it with prisma db execute (schema and migration artifacts are valid and present).
