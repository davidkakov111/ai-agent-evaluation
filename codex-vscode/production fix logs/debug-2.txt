You’re correct. That’s a gap, and your original requirement was clear.

What happened:

Backend support does exist for org creation:
organization router (organization.create)
organization service (createOrganization)
But UI flow for “Create organization” was not added on the post-login pre-join page:
organizations page
So:

It’s not “located somewhere else” in UI.
It was omitted in implementation.
Root cause is planning/coverage mistake: the later plan/UI step emphasized directory + join-request flow and missed explicit “create organization” UI, even though your initial spec required it.
If you want, I can add the missing create-organization form/flow now on /organizations and wire it to organization.create.

ME: Yes pls.

You were right to flag it. I added the missing feature now.

Implemented:

New create-org UI component:
create-organization-form.tsx
Wired it into organizations page:
organizations/page.tsx
What it does:

On /organizations, user now sees Create Organization form.
Fields: name, slug (+ “Suggest” slug button).
Calls existing organization.create tRPC API.
On success, redirects to /dashboard (creator becomes OWNER as backend already enforces).
Validation:

npm run lint passed
npm run typecheck passed
npm run build passed
To test in Docker:

docker compose down
docker compose up --build
Register/login → go to /organizations → create org → should land on /dashboard.
