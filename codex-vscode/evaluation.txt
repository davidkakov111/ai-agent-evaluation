⭐ AI Developer Productivity Scorecard:

| Metric                   | Question To Evaluate                                                                       | Score (0-10) | Why? 
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |--------------------------------------------------------------------
| Idea Match               | Did the AI correctly implement the requested project idea and features?                    |     8.5      | Final system matches spec. But missing create-org UI and wrong status transitions show incomplete first-pass coverage.
| Architecture Quality     | Is the project structure clean, scalable, and logically separated (DB, API, UI, services)? |     8.8      | Clean, well-layered structure with proper separation of concerns and scalable boundaries, where all identified issues were localized logic gaps rather than structural flaws or cross-layer design failures.
| Security + Authorization | Are roles, permissions, and data isolation correctly enforced in backend logic?            |     8.5      | Multi-tenant checks exist, membership checks exist, join approval fixed correctly. No catastrophic data leaks observed except the SignIn redirect server error.
| TypeScript Quality       | Is the code strongly typed, readable, and free of type safety shortcuts?                   |     9.5      | Empty string slipping through compile-time and only caught by runtime validation (which is acceptable design, but perfect domain modeling could have used branded types or stricter input modeling)
| Code Quality             | Is the code clean, maintainable, and not unnecessarily complex?                            |     8        | Code is clean, maintainable and not unecessarily complex and fixes were clean and localized. No massive rewrites required. But multiple state bugs mean initial implementation wasn’t airtight.
| Debugging Skill          | Did the AI correctly identify and fix bugs during review phase?                            |     10       | This is strong. It correctly identified root causes every time and applied targeted fixes without breaking other parts. That’s senior-level debugging behavior.
| Deployment Quality       | Does Docker + startup setup work with minimal manual fixing?                               |     10       | Docker rebuild worked. Prisma 7 migration handled correctly including adapter + generate + entrypoint hardening. That’s solid.
| Use Existing Solutions   | Did the AI use established libraries instead of reinventing functionality?                 |     9        | Used NextAuth, Prisma, Zod, tRPC, proper adapters. Did not reinvent infrastructure. Good engineering instinct. (But instead of html you could use some UI libraries like mui material)
| Autonomy                 | How independently did the AI complete tasks without you guiding implementation?            |     8.5      | It implemented full system itself, but I caught 8 issues. So it’s not autonomous perfection. Still high independence.

⭐ Most Important Real Productivity Question (Answer Separately)
    How much did I personally need to correct, rewrite, or guide the AI to reach the final desired result?
    ANSWARE: I did not manually write or rewrite any code. My role was reviewing, testing, and reporting issues. All fixes were resolved by the AI in single prompts. Total elapsed time was around 5-6 hours, but much of that included waiting and interaction overhead rather than active engineering work.

Planning Score: 8 / 10
    Description: This score reflects strong high-level architecture planning with clear system boundaries, but incomplete spec coverage due to missed edge cases, state transition logic, and one missing feature implementation.

Implementation Score: 8.3 / 10
    Description: This score reflects solid structural implementation with localized logic and state-sync bugs, rather than architectural failures or cascading system instability, meaning it required fixes but not major refactoring.

Any other notes/observations?
    I don’t have a paid subscription for Codex, so:
        For Steps 5, 6, 7, and 8, I used the model’s second-best reasoning option.
        For Steps 9 and 10, I used only the third-best reasoning option.
    This makes the comparison somewhat unfair to CODEX compared to other paid models, but I didn’t want to spend $20 just to complete the test using the model’s maximum capability.

    It created a Prisma seed file and CI/CD verifications & build, which is useful. I didn’t ask for it, but it was a nice touch from Codex — I really liked that.

    ERROR

    After signup/signin, I received a server error.  
    The AI resolved it. Here is the debugging AI answare: debug-1.txt
    ----------------------------------------
    ----------------------------------------
    MISSING FUNCTIONALITY

    The “Create Organization” UI was missing, even though the backend part had been implemented.  
    The root cause was a planning/coverage mistake.

    NOT USER-FRIENDLY ERROR MESSAGE

    During registration password validation, I received the following error:
        [ { "origin": "string", "code": "invalid_format", "format": "regex", "pattern": "/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\\d).+$/", "path": [ "password" ], "message": "Password must include uppercase, lowercase, and numeric characters." } ]
    The error exposes the regex pattern, which is not user-friendly.  

    This was an implementation issue. Here is the AI’s explanation and solution logs: debug-3.txt

    ----------------------------------------
    MISSING TASK STATE

    The AI missed the TODO state due to an implementation mistake.
    Here is the AI’s response and resolution prompt: debug-4.txt
    ----------------------------------------
    ----------------------------------------
    BUG

    There was a bug in the task state update implementation.  
    After multiple consecutive updates, this error occurred:
        'Invalid task status transition.'

    ----------------------------------------
    DEPRECATED PRISMA USAGE

    Prisma had a newer version than the one the AI initially used.
    I asked the AI to upgrade the project to Prisma v7, which required significant logic restructuring. Major Prisma upgrades aren’t easy, but the AI managed to complete it in under 20 minutes, though it consumed many tokens — likely due to limited online examples for the latest version.
    AI response and resolution prompt: debug-6.txt
    ----------------------------------------
    ----------------------------------------
    BUG

    The bug occurred because the React state wasn’t synchronized when a new member joined the organization, so I couldn’t assign a task to the new member immediately without reloading the page.
    AI response and resolution prompt: debug-7.txt
    ----------------------------------------
    ----------------------------------------
    BUG

    If a user sends join requests to multiple organizations and gets approved in one, the pending requests in the other organizations become stuck. They can neither be approved nor properly canceled, resulting in a frozen state due to missing state handling logic.

    ----------------------------------------
    
    Overall, I’m really impressed with the code quality. I didn’t review every file in depth, but what I checked looks clean, well-structured, and free of obvious issues.
    The only thing I slightly miss is comments — I didn’t ask for them, so it’s understandable, but they would have been a nice addition.

    GENERAL NOTE: This is not an issue, but it’s important to understand that the AI will strictly follow the instructions provided. Since I did not request comments in the code, it did not include them.

Time to implement evrything was: 1 h 15 min + production debugging (roughly 4 h with careful manual testing) 

Monthly cost: $23
