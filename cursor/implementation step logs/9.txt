Step 9 is done. Implemented changes:
Organizations
CreateOrganizationForm – Form with name, slug, and “Suggest” button; creates org and redirects to dashboard
OrgList – Lists discoverable orgs with “Member” badge or “Request to join” button
RequestJoinButton – Sends join request and shows loading/success states
Join requests
PendingJoinRequestsList – Lists pending join requests (owner/admin only)
ApproveRejectButtons – Approve (with role: EMPLOYEE/ADMIN) or reject
Tasks
TaskList – Task list filtered by role (employees see only their tasks)
TaskCard – Shows title, description, status, assignee, and actions
CreateTaskForm – Create task with assignee dropdown (owner/admin only)
UpdateStatusSelect – Status dropdown (TODO→IN_PROGRESS→DONE) for allowed transitions
ReassignSelect – Reassign to another employee (owner/admin only)
Pages
/organizations – Create org form and discoverable org list with join requests
/dashboard – Pending join requests (owner/admin), create task form (owner/admin), and task list
Role-based visibility:
Employees: Only their tasks; can update status on their own tasks
Owners/Admins: All tasks; create, reassign, approve/reject join requests
Build succeeds. Run npm run dev to try the flow.
