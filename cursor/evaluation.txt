⭐ AI Developer Productivity Scorecard:

| Metric                   | Question To Evaluate                                                                       | Score (0-10) | Why?
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |--------------------------------------------------------------------
| Idea Match               | Did the AI correctly implement the requested project idea and features?                    |    9.5       | The final system matches your requested multi-tenant task SaaS with roles, lifecycle, org management with onyl one bug.
| Architecture Quality     | Is the project structure clean, scalable, and logically separated (DB, API, UI, services)? |    9.3       | Strong modular architecture with proper layering and domain separation. Lifecycle rules are centralized and consistently applied. No coupling or structural weaknesses were exposed during debugging. One minor business rule was missing, but the architecture supported the fix cleanly without refactoring.
| Security + Authorization | Are roles, permissions, and data isolation correctly enforced in backend logic?            |    9.5       | The system correctly enforced backend role checks and strict multi-tenant isolation with no authorization bypasses, and the only issue observed was a business rule gap unrelated to authentication or access control.
| TypeScript Quality       | Is the code strongly typed, readable, and free of type safety shortcuts?                   |    10        | Strong typing, no hacks mentioned, no unsafe shortcuts reported. No type-driven architectural issues.
| Code Quality             | Is the code clean, maintainable, and not unnecessarily complex?                            |    9         | Clean code, but with bug and missed UX improvements. 
| Debugging Skill          | Did the AI correctly identify and fix bugs during review phase?                            |    10        | This is strong. It correctly identified root causes every time and applied targeted fixes without breaking other parts. That’s senior-level debugging behavior.
| Deployment Quality       | Does Docker + startup setup work with minimal manual fixing?                               |    10        | Docker rebuild worked. That’s solid.
| Use Existing Solutions   | Did the AI use established libraries instead of reinventing functionality?                 |    9         | Used NextAuth, Prisma, Zod, tRPC, proper adapters. Did not reinvent infrastructure. Good engineering instinct. (But instead of html you could use some UI libraries like mui material)
| Autonomy                 | How independently did the AI complete tasks without you guiding implementation?            |    9.1       | It implemented full system itself, but I caught 4 issues. So it’s not autonomous perfection. Still high independence.

⭐ Most Important Real Productivity Question (Answer Separately)
    How much did I personally need to correct, rewrite, or guide the AI to reach the final desired result?
    ANSWARE: I did not manually write or rewrite any code. My role was reviewing, testing, and reporting issues. All fixes were resolved by the AI in single prompts. Total elapsed time was around 2-3 hours, but much of that included waiting and interaction overhead rather than active engineering work.

Planning Score: 9 / 10
    Description: Why: plan defined lifecycle, but failed to propagate terminal-state logic to reassignment, missed session refresh edge case, missed UI visibility conditions. These are edge-case completeness failures. Not structural failures.

Implementation Score: 9 / 10
    Description: Why: Followed plan correctly, debugging responses were sharp, fixes were minimal and correct, no cascading instability but missed some UX improvements. The system behaved like a mid-to-senior dev under supervision.

Any other notes/observations?
    It created a plan file in the editor with a visual, diagram-style architecture drawing. I could highlight elements and add them to the chat so the AI could act on them. It was easy to use, much better integrated than VS Code, and the AI was very fast.
    It has a built-in browser inside the editor.
    It frequently asked for confirmation with recommended options.
    It took one hour to build the idea following the evaluation plan.

    BUG 

    A task can be reassigned even if it has already been completed. 
    The reason was a planning mistake.

    BAD UX

    If I belong to an organization, I still see join buttons for others. These should be disabled since I can’t join another organization once I’m already in one.
    The organization creation form should also be hidden if I already belong to an organization, as it’s redundant and misleading.
    The reason was an implementation mistake.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    BAD UX

    After I approve the first employee request, the task assigner section does not appear automatically — only after a page reload.
    If the task assigner is already visible and I approve another user, the new user does not appear in the dropdown. We likely need to refresh the employees array.
    The reason was an implementation mistake.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    BAD UX

    After creating an organization, the user session is not updated until a page reload.
    This causes two issues:
        The dashboard shows only the employee view until reload.
        The header misses the dashboard link until reload.
    The reason was an implementation mistake.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    Overall, I’m really impressed with the code quality. I didn’t review every file in depth, but what I checked looks clean, well-structured, and free of obvious issues.
    The only thing I slightly miss is comments — I didn’t ask for them, so it’s understandable, but they would have been a nice addition.

    GENERAL NOTE: This is not an issue, but it’s important to understand that the AI will strictly follow the instructions provided. Since I did not request comments in the code, it did not include them.
