Summary of updates:
Root cause: This was mainly an implementation gap. The plan said "Request to join for orgs user doesn't belong to" and "Create organization" form, but didn’t say to hide/disable them when the user already has an org. The UI should have used session.user.organizationId to adjust what’s shown.
Changes made:
Create organization form – Hidden when session?.user?.organizationId is set.
Join buttons – Replaced with "Already in an organization" when the user already belongs to an org.
Page copy – Switched from "Create an organization or request to join one" to "Browse organizations" when the user has an org.
