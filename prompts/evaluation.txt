| Idea Match               | Did the AI correctly implement the requested project idea and features?                    |              |
| Architecture Quality     | Is the project structure clean, scalable, and logically separated (DB, API, UI, services)? |              |
| Security + Authorization | Are roles, permissions, and data isolation correctly enforced in backend logic?            |              |
| TypeScript Quality       | Is the code strongly typed, readable, and free of type safety shortcuts?                   |              |
| Code Quality             | Is the code clean, maintainable, and not unnecessarily complex?                            |              |
| Debugging Skill          | Did the AI correctly identify and fix bugs during review phase?                            |              |
| Deployment Quality       | Does Docker + startup setup work with minimal manual fixing?                               |              |
| Use Existing Solutions   | Did the AI use established libraries instead of reinventing functionality?                 |              |
| Autonomy                 | How independently did the AI complete tasks without you guiding implementation?            |              |
