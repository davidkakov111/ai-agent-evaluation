Now dockerize the entire project so it can be started from zero using Docker Compose.

Generate:

1. Production-ready Dockerfile
2. docker-compose.yaml
3. Any required configuration files
4. Environment variable setup instructions
5. Database migration handling inside the container

Requirements:

- The application must start with:
  docker compose up

- Prisma migrations must run automatically during container startup

- Follow production best practices:
  - Multi-stage builds if applicable
  - Minimal final image size
  - Proper dependency installation separation
  - Proper Node.js production configuration

- Do NOT use development-only patterns.

- Do not change project architecture unless absolutely required.

Verify that the Docker setup can:
- Run database migrations
- Start backend services
- Serve frontend application
- Handle environment variables correctly

If any production risks exist, explain them and fix them.
