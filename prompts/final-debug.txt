Review the current codebase.

Check for:
- Bugs
- TypeScript type safety issues
- Security vulnerabilities
- Architecture problems
- Performance risks
- Missing edge case handling

Also check:
- Whether code follows the previously defined architecture and design decisions
- Whether there are redundant or unnecessary implementations

If you find problems:
- Clearly explain why they are problems
- Provide corrected production-quality code for the affected files only
- Do not rewrite the entire project unless absolutely necessary
