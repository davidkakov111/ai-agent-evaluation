⭐ AI Developer Productivity Scorecard:

| Metric                   | Question To Evaluate                                                                       | Score (0-10) |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| Idea Match               | Did the AI correctly implement the requested project idea and features?                    |              |
| Architecture Quality     | Is the project structure clean, scalable, and logically separated (DB, API, UI, services)? |              |
| Security + Authorization | Are roles, permissions, and data isolation correctly enforced in backend logic?            |              |
| TypeScript Quality       | Is the code strongly typed, readable, and free of type safety shortcuts?                   |              |
| Code Quality             | Is the code clean, maintainable, and not unnecessarily complex?                            |              |
| Debugging Skill          | Did the AI correctly identify and fix bugs during review phase?                            |              |
| Deployment Quality       | Does Docker + startup setup work with minimal manual fixing?                               |              |
| Use Existing Solutions   | Did the AI use established libraries instead of reinventing functionality?                 |              |
| Autonomy                 | How independently did the AI complete tasks without you guiding implementation?            |              |

⭐ Most Important Real Productivity Question (Answer Separately)
    How much did I personally need to correct, rewrite, or guide the AI to reach the final desired result?

⭐ Any other notes/observations?
    I don’t have a paid subscription for Codex, so:
        For Steps 5, 6, 7, and 8, I used the model’s second-best reasoning option.
        For Steps 9 and 10, I used only the third-best reasoning option.
    This makes the comparison somewhat unfair to GPT compared to other paid models, but I didn’t want to spend $20 just to complete the test using the model’s maximum capability.

    It created a Prisma seed file and CI/CD verifications & build, which is useful. I didn’t ask for it, but it was a nice touch from Codex — I really liked that.

    ----------------------------------------
    ERROR

    After signup/signin, I received a server error.  
    The AI resolved it. Here is the debugging AI answare: debug-1.txt
    ----------------------------------------
    ----------------------------------------
    MISSING FUNCTIONALITY

    The “Create Organization” UI was missing, even though the backend part had been implemented.  
    The root cause was a planning/coverage mistake.

    ----------------------------------------
    ----------------------------------------
    NOT USER-FRIENDLY ERROR MESSAGE

    During registration password validation, I received the following error:
        [ { "origin": "string", "code": "invalid_format", "format": "regex", "pattern": "/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\\d).+$/", "path": [ "password" ], "message": "Password must include uppercase, lowercase, and numeric characters." } ]
    The error exposes the regex pattern, which is not user-friendly.  

    This was an implementation issue. Here is the AI’s explanation and solution logs: debug-3.txt
    ----------------------------------------
    ----------------------------------------
    MISSING TASK STATE

    The AI missed the TODO state due to an implementation mistake.
    Here is the AI’s response and resolution prompt: debug-4.txt
    ----------------------------------------
    ----------------------------------------
    ERROR

    There was a bug in the task state update implementation.  
    After multiple consecutive updates, this error occurred:
        'Invalid task status transition.'
    The AI responded and resolved it: debug-5.txt
    ----------------------------------------

    GENERAL NOTE: Its not a problem, but good to knwo htet ai will do what you ask from it and not more, like i didnt asked it to write comments so it skipp the comments etc.
    

Time to implement evrything was: 1 h 15 min 

Monthly cost: $23
