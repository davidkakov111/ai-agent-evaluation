Step 10 is implemented and validated.

Implemented

Environment contract finalized in .env.example
Added NODE_ENV
Kept required runtime vars (DATABASE_URL, NEXTAUTH_URL, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS)
Production startup/migration scripts finalized in package.json
Added setup
Added start:prod (prisma migrate deploy + next start)
Operational documentation replaced with production runbook in README.md
Local run, quality gates, migration flow, SQLite backup note, v1 SQLite limits, Postgres migration path
Structured server logging added in logger.ts
Centralized tRPC error-path logging added in map-error-to-trpc.ts
Safe App Router error boundaries added:
error.tsx
global-error.tsx
Replaced ad-hoc server-page console.error with structured logging:
dashboard/page.tsx
organizations/page.tsx
SQLite file ignores hardened in .gitignore
Validation

npm run prisma:validate passed
npm run typecheck passed
npm run lint passed with --max-warnings=0
npm run test passed (16/16)
npm run build passed
This completes the final plan step and finalizes the app at production-readiness v1 level (with SQLite constraints documented explicitly).
